### Abstract

There’s long been a simmering belief that basketball’s traditional positional labels
(point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, center) are insufficient in
fully describing a player’s role and activity on the court. Today, more than ever, the
issue is bubbling over, and we see players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, et
al. bending the rules ascribed to players of their position by traditionalists - we need to
adapt our viewing/analyzing paradigms accordingly. Muthu Alagappan famously made
an effort to reposition NBA players at Sloan 2012, but his analysis falls short for me.
The main issue I find is that a number of his positions fail to impart any sense of how
the players of that position actually play on the floor, the most egregious among them,
‘role players’, being a position comprised of roughly the same number of players as
about 5 other positions combined. In all, a rough visual estimate tells me that, in this
analysis, roughly one-third of all NBA players wind up in this ‘role player’ position; this
is problematic, to say the least.
My aim in this study is two-fold: the first section is concerned with defining better
positions, while the second will use these positions to determine if there is an ideal
distribution of player-types on a team.
