## Abstract

There’s long been a simmering belief that basketball’s traditional positional labels
(point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, center) are insufficient in
fully describing a player’s role and activity on the court. Today, more than ever, the
issue is bubbling over, and we see players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, et
al. bending the rules ascribed to players of their position by traditionalists - we need to
adapt our viewing/analyzing paradigms accordingly. [Muthu Alagappan famously made
an effort to reposition NBA players at Sloan 2012](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Alagappan-Muthu-EOSMarch2012PPT.pdf), but his analysis falls short for me.
The main issue I find is that a number of his positions fail to impart any sense of how
the players of that position actually play on the floor, the most egregious among them,
‘role players’, being a position comprised of roughly the same number of players as
about *five* other positions combined. In all, a rough visual estimate tells me that, in this
analysis, roughly one-third of all NBA players wind up in this ‘role player’ position; this
is problematic, to say the least.
My aim in this study is two-fold: the first section is concerned with defining better
positions, while the second will use these positions to determine if there is an ideal
distribution of player-types on a team.
  
  
## Data
  
Data was culled from a variety of sources - [Basketball Reference](http://basketball-reference.com) was immensely helpful to get started, as I was able to easily get 2016-17 advanced stats for players who met a set of criteria, to wit: at least 50 games played on the season, and at least 10 minutes played per game.  Basketball Reference has a handy 'Get Table as CSV' option which made using this data a snap: 
![basketball reference](https://github.com/tilla232/dsi_capstone/blob/master/img/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-08%20at%2011.51.07%20AM.png?raw=true)  
  
 While Basketball Reference was helpful in providing me most of the stats I needed, it also served to provide my player list that I could use to scrape the data I still needed from other sources, namely, [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com), an impressive collection of basic and advanced stats, and, more importantly, proprietary tracking stats that can't be found on the otherwise-robust Basketball Reference.  The NBA doesn't have an API, so I turned to a fantastic python package, [nba_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py) to help me scrape the data I needed.  Once I used a different package ([py_Goldsberry](https://github.com/bradleyfay/py-Goldsberry)) to create a player ID dictionary containing only the players I would be using in my model, using nba_py to pull statistics became trivial.  
   
## Model  
### Clustering
Clustering is a messy matter to begin with, and was only further complicated, in this study, by the cluster overlap we would almost inherently find, regardless of model selection and parameter tuning.  Our model is built around NBA players, almost none of whom are abjectly *terrible* at any one aspect of the game.  We would expect players from cluster 1 to be at least serviceable when it comes to the skills that players from cluster 2 thrive at, etc.  This fact alone made it hard to quantify success in our clustering, as we would almost expect something like mean silhouette score to have a fairly low cap.
